              <br />
              Reach tall and exhale forward, then bend knees enough to be able
              to place your palms on the floor, with head pressed against your
              legs. Be aware of your spine stretching in different directions as
              you pull your head down and in. For a deeper stretch, try to
              straighten the legs. Hold this pose for 6-8 breaths, then whilst
              inhaling, stretch arms outwards and raise them and your torso back
              to the standing position
